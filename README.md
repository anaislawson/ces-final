# Final Project

## Component Wiring

### Servo Motor
- Connect the orange wire (first wire) to `GPIO Pin #13`slot on breadboard
- Connect the red wire (second wire) to the 5V slot on breadboard
- Connect the brown wire (third wire) to a ground slot on breadboard
### Stepper Motor
- Connect IN1 to `GPIO Pin #15` slot on breadboard
- Connect IN2 to `GPIO Pin #27` slot on breadboard
- Connect IN3 to `GPIO Pin #26` slot on breadboard
- Connect IN4 to `GPIO Pin #25` slot on breadboard
On the side with 2 pins
- Connect (-) pin to the ground slot on breadboard
- Connect (+) pin to the 5V slot on breadboard
### Motion Sensor
With the motion sensor oriented downward we the pins are at the bottom
- Connect leftmost pin to 5V slot on breadboard
- Connect middle pin to `GPIO Pin #17` slot on breadboard
- Connect rightmost pin to ground slot on breadboard
### LED Strip
- Connect the red wire (first wire) to  the 5V slot on breadboard
- Connect the green wire (second wire) to `GPIO Pin #2` slot on breadboard
- Connect the white wire (third wire) to a ground slot on breadboard
### Potentiometer
Using image at bottom:
- Connect the pin `1` to 3V slot on breadboard
- Connect the pin `2` to `GPIO Pin #12`slot on breadboard
- Connect the pin `3` to ground slot on breadboard
---
### Build Enclosure
- Use .svg files to build up enclosures
- remove joystick slot (bigger circle next to smaller circle)
- remove ESP display slot (rectangle next to small circle)
---
### Modifying front and bottom enclosure
- On the side that aligns with the LED strips, use the dremel to smooth out 6 or 7 of the teeth on both the front and bottom piece of enclosure
---
### LED strip usage
- Wrap LED strip through first slot and wrap through second and third then wrap the remainder through the slots horizontally
---
### Component assembly
- Use hot glue and electric tape to hold pieces in place, howeve4r you deem fit.
---
### Decorative Components
- Cotton balls to cover LED strip slots
- Use 3D sun and cylinder to hot glue on top of the stepper motor
